## When to Use
When finalizing an agreement, sale, or partnership.

## Steps
1. **Summarize Terms** — Recap all agreed-upon terms clearly
2. **Request Confirmation** — Ask for explicit written agreement
3. **Handle Objections** — Address any last-minute concerns
4. **Finalize** — Exchange signed documents or confirm via email
5. **Welcome/Onboard** — Send welcome message or next steps

## Guidelines
- NEVER send final agreements without user approval
- Flag any changes to previously agreed terms
- Keep a clear paper trail of all commitments
- Verify identity before exchanging sensitive documents
