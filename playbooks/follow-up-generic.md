# Generic Follow-Up

## When to Use
When a thread has gone quiet and needs a nudge.

## Steps
1. **Wait** — Allow the configured follow-up period to pass
2. **Gentle Nudge** — Send a friendly follow-up
3. **Escalate** — If no response after 2nd follow-up, flag for user attention
4. **Close** — If no response after 3 attempts, archive the thread

Hi [name],

Just following up on my previous message about [topic]. I wanted to check if you had a chance to review it.

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Best,

## Timing
- First follow-up: After configured follow-up days
- Second follow-up: 3 days after first
- Archive: 7 days after second with no response

## Goal
Get a response or gracefully close the thread.
