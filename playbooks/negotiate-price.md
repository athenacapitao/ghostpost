# Negotiate Price

## When to Use
When negotiating pricing, rates, or contract terms.

## Steps
1. **Research** — Understand market rates and your BATNA
2. **Initial Offer** — Start with your ideal terms
3. **Counter** — Respond to counteroffers with reasoned adjustments
4. **Close** — Confirm agreed terms in writing

## Guidelines
- Never commit to a price without explicit user approval
- Always get terms in writing before confirming
- Flag any urgency pressure as a negotiation tactic
- Keep records of all offers and counteroffers

Thank you for your proposal. After reviewing, I'd like to suggest [counter-terms].

[Reasoning for the counter]

I'm open to discussing this further. Would you be available to chat about it?

Best,
